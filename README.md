## üìå Issues

When used with the current server implementation the external address configuration value
will have to be correct or features like Galaxy At War, Shop Icons, Etc won't work. This is
planned to be fixed in the next iteration of this client which will create proxies for any
of the additional servers fixing this issue


## ‚ùîWhat

This is a tool for Redirecting your local Mass Effect 3 clients to an Unofficial server. The
address and port you put into this tool will be the address and port that the Mass Effect 3
client receives. This tool relies on creating a hosts file redirect for gosredirector.ea.com
to 127.0.0.1 and this client spawns a local server which Hijacks the redirect process.

## ‚ùîHow

This tool uses the system hosts file at `C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts` and adds
`127.0.0.1 gosredirector.ea.com` which tells your computer to send all the traffic that
would normally go to `gosredirector.ea.com` to `127.0.0.1` (Your computer) then this tool
runs a local server using [BlazeSSL (https://github.com/jacobtread/blaze-ssl)](https://github.com/jacobtread/blaze-ssl)
and pretends to be the official Mass Effect 3 servers.

## üîåRequirements

In order to use this tool your Mass Effect 3 game must be patched with the Blinkw32 proxy DDL
